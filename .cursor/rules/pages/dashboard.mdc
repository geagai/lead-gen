# /dashboard Page (Live User Dashboard)

## Purpose
- Serves as the main user dashboard after login
- Displays user account summary, active subscriptions, and all purchases (subscriptions and one-off payments)

## Key UI Blocks/Components
- **DashboardHeader**: Shows user name, email, user ID, and credits (all from user_data table)
- **Active Subscriptions Block**: Shows a table of all active subscriptions for the user (from subscriptions table)
  - Columns: Subscription ID, Cost, Billing Term, Created At, Status (with green highlight), Action ("Manage Subscription" button for monthly/yearly terms)
  - Only subscriptions with status = 'active' and billing_term = 'month', 'monthly', 'year', or 'yearly' are shown
- **Purchases Block**: Shows a table of all purchases (subscriptions and one-off payments) for the user (from subscriptions table)
  - Columns: Subscription ID, Cost, Billing Term, Created At, Status (always 'Paid', blue highlight)
  - All records are shown, regardless of status or billing term
  - No Action column in this table
- **(Removed) Payment History Block**: Previously showed payment history, now removed

## Data Sources
- **user_data table**: Used to fetch user email, role, credits, and UID (primary key for user lookups)
- **subscriptions table**: Used to fetch all subscriptions and purchases for the current user (filtered by UID)
- **auth.users table**: Used for authentication and UID reference

## Special Logic
- All dashboard data blocks are only rendered if the user_data table exists in the database (prevents errors if missing)
- Active Subscriptions table is filtered to only show rows with status = 'active' and billing_term = 'month', 'monthly', 'year', or 'yearly'
- Purchases table shows all records, regardless of status or billing term, and always displays 'Paid' in the Status column
- "Manage Subscription" button (Action column) only appears in the Active Subscriptions table for monthly/yearly subscriptions
- User ID block now displays UID from user_data, not just auth.users.id
- Layout: All main blocks are full width, stacked vertically, with 20px margin above Active Subscriptions

## Conditional Rendering
- If user_data table does not exist, none of the dashboard blocks are rendered
- If no active subscriptions, the Active Subscriptions table is not shown
- If no purchases, the Purchases table is not shown

## Styling/UX
- Uses Tailwind CSS for layout and spacing
- Table columns are compact, with status highlighted in green (Active Subscriptions) or blue (Purchases)
- Action buttons styled as primary, only in Active Subscriptions
