# Supabase Project Configuration – NextGeag BP

This rule file stores the canonical identifiers for our Supabase backend so any agent or MCP tool can consistently target the correct project.

## Project Details

| Key | Value |
| --- | ----- |
| **Project Name** | NextGeag BP |
| **Project ID** | ${SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID} |

## Usage Guidance

1. **Default project** – Whenever you invoke an `mcp_supabase_*` tool, set `project_id` to `${SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID}` unless the user explicitly specifies a different project.
2. **Environment variables** – If a tool requires `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`, use the value above.
3. **Security** – Do not expose service-role keys in chat logs; only the public project id is stored here.

> _Rationale:_ Centralising the project metadata in this rule prevents typos and makes future project migrations easier (change it here once and every tool call will reference the new ID)._
